# aws-transcribe-captions-live
This repo is for a AWS Reinvent Workshop. AWS Transcribe converts the audio track of video files into text. Then this text is used to generate captions for the VOD files. This code contains, AWS Transcribe, AWS Polly, AWS Translate, AWS Lambda, AWS Cloudformation, and S3. Note it will not contain the binary ffmpeg or ffprobe that is contained on my code.amazon repository.
